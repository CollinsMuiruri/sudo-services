Description

This is a simple website that collects information from service providers and linking them with customers/clients around a current location.

Technologies Used

As a basic startup website, we used HTML,CSS for styling and a bit of JavaScript.

Navigation

At the start page, there are 2 buttons that give you the option of chosing whether to offer services or locate a service near you. On both pages there are forms that should be filled and submitted.

Support and Contact Details

Incase of any difficulty you can reach us on Slack @Dnyt or @leskey
